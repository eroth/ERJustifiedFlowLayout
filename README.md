## About
This is for an iOS project and can be used on any iPad or iPhone.  `ERJustifiedFlowLayout` is a subclass of Apple's `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` class, which is designed to be used in combination with a `UICollectionView`.  This project assumes you are familiar with the latter—if not, you can read about `UICollectionView` [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/CollectionViewPGforIOS/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012334-CH1-SW1) and you can read about `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/CollectionViewPGforIOS/UsingtheFlowLayout/UsingtheFlowLayout.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012334-CH3-SW1).

`ERJustifiedFlowLayout` works with dynamic or static-sized `UICollectionViewCells`, as it only handles the layout aspect.

This project contains some code from the following sources:
[Michael Sand's answer to a question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28374247/482557) and [this Cocoanetics tutorial](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/08/variable-sized-items-in-uicollectionview/).  Thanks for the inspiration!

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## Requirements
Tested on iOS 7 and 8 on all iPads and iPhones from 4S to 6+.

## Installation

ERJustifiedFlowLayout is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "ERJustifiedFlowLayout"
```

## Instructions
ERJustifiedFlowLayout can be used programmatically in the `viewDidLoad` method of the view controller your collection view is in:

```ERJustifiedFlowLayout *flowLayout = [[ERJustifiedFlowLayout  alloc] init];```

or a reference to it can be created from your xib/storyboard like so:

![alt text](Art/Xcode-setup.png "Create a reference to your ERJustifiedFlowLayout instance from a xib or storyboard")

Once instantiated or referenced, `ERJustifiedFlowLayout` requires only the setting of one property, with a few others as options:

* **Required**: `FlowLayoutHorizontalJustification`—an enum on `ERJustifiedFlowLayout` that sets the type of horizontal justification to perform:
	* `FlowLayoutHorizontalJustificationLeft`
	* `FlowLayoutHorizontalJustificationFull`
	* `FlowLayoutHorizontalJustificationRight`
* **Optional**
	* `horizontalCellPadding`: controls the amount of absolute space between each cell.  Default is `0`.  This property overrides the `minimumInteritemSpacing` property on `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.
	* `sectionInset`: this `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` property can be set to provide left, right, top, and bottom section insets which are used in calculating cell justification.

## Versions
1.0: Initial version
1.1: Fixes issues [#2](../../issues/2), [#4](../../issues/4), and [#9](../../issues/9) (thanks a lot, [Sega-Zero](https://github.com/Sega-Zero)!!!)

## Improvements
Ability to vertically align cells (top, middle, bottom) is coming soon, as is the ability to horizontally center justify cells.
